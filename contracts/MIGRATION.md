# VaccinationRecord Migration Guide

This document outlines the migration path for `VaccinationRecord` schema changes in the VacciChain contract.

## Current Schema (Version 1)

```rust
pub struct VaccinationRecord {
    pub token_id: u64,
    pub patient: Address,
    pub vaccine_name: String,
    pub date_administered: String,
    pub issuer: Address,
    pub timestamp: u64,
    pub schema_version: u32, // Added in #47
}
```

## Strategy for Schema Evolution

### 1. Adding Optional Fields
To add new fields without breaking existing records, use `Option<T>`. Soroban will deserialize missing fields as `None`.

### 2. Breaking Changes (Major Version Bump)
For breaking changes (e.g., removing fields or changing types):
1.  Define a new struct (e.g., `VaccinationRecordV2`).
2.  Update the `DataKey::Token` to store an `enum` wrapper:
    ```rust
    #[contracttype]
    pub enum VaccinationRecord {
        V1(VaccinationRecordV1),
        V2(VaccinationRecordV2),
    }
    ```
3.  Implement a "Lazy Migration" in `verify_vaccination`:
    -   When reading a record, check its version.
    -   If it's an old version, optionally migrate it to the latest version in storage when it's next accessed.

### 3. Graceful Handling in `verify_vaccination`
The `verify_vaccination` function should continue to support older versions by:
-   Using a common trait or converting older records to the latest internal representation before returning them to the caller.
-   Ignoring records that cannot be parsed if they are considered "corrupt" or from a version no longer supported.
